### Hi there! I'm Joseph (he/him). Thanks for visiting! ðŸ‘‹

I am a 26 year old back-end engineer with a 3 years of Business Analyst experience. I am currently enrolled in the Turing School of Software & Design, studying back-end tools such as Ruby, Rails, and SQL.

I decided to enter software engineering so that I may use my analytical and creative brain to make a difference in the world. Creating tangible results is important to me and I have always had an interest in software engineering. Thanks to a push from my older brother (who has been writing code for ~10 years), I decided to take the leap!

I am excited to update this README as I progress in my journey. Hopefully, you check in from time to time and follow along!

Outside of work and studies, I have a couple hobbies, which include playing Texas Hold'em, building watches, and attending a slew of live concerts. 

If you have any questions about me, or simply want to chat, you can reach me at jhjlee702@gmail.com.
