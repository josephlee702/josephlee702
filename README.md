### Hi there! I'm Joseph (he/him). Thanks for visiting! ðŸ‘‹

I am a 27 year old back-end engineer with a 3 years of Business Analyst experience. I graduated from the Turing School of Software & Design, studying back-end tools such as Ruby on Rails, RESTful APIs, GraphQL applications, and SQL. I also have exposure to front-end elements such as React, HTML and CSS, and I am in the process of mastering Javascript through Youtube and The Odin Project(highly recommend these free resources). I love to write clean, professional code, with an emphasis on TDD (Test Driven Development).

I decided to enter software engineering so that I may use my analytical and creative brain to make a difference in the world. Creating tangible results is important to me and I have always had an interest in software engineering. Thanks to a push from my older brother (who has been writing code for ~10 years), I decided to take the leap! ðŸ¦˜

I am excited to update this README as I progress in my journey. Hopefully, you check in from time to time and follow along!

Outside of work and studies, I have a couple hobbies, which include playing Texas Hold'em, tinkering with watches, and attending live concerts. 

If you have any questions about me, or simply want to chat, you can reach me at jhjlee702@gmail.com.

Cheers!
